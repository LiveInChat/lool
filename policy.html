<p>Europe</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom (“UK”), you have certain rights and protections under The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regarding the processing of your personal data. GDPR is an EU law intended to strengthen and unify the data protection and data privacy regulations and rights for the benefit and protection of EU, EEA, and UK data subjects. In addition to the notice provided above, the following notice applies to EU, EEA, and UK data subjects. In the event there is a conflict between the two as it applies to EU data subjects, this section shall take precedence. For purposes of this section, the term “Personal Data” shall have the meaning given by Regulation (EU) 2016/679. LO_OL will be the Data Controller responsible for determining the purposes and means of processing your personal information.</p>
<p>If you live in the EU, EEA or UK, you have the right under GDPR to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to be informed: Data subjects have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.</li>
<li>Right to access: Data subjects have the right to view and request copies of their personal data.</li>
<li>Right to rectification: Data subjects have the right to request inaccurate or outdated personal information be updated or corrected.</li>
<li>Right to be forgotten/Right to erasure: Data subjects have the right to request their personal data be deleted. Note that this is not an absolute right and may be subject to exemptions based on certain laws.</li>
<li>Right to data portability: Data subjects have the right to ask for their data to be transferred to another controller or provided to them. The data must be provided in a machine-readable electronic format.</li>
<li>Right to restrict processing: Data subjects have the right to request the restriction or suppression of their personal data.</li>
<li>Right to withdraw consent: Data subjects have the right to withdraw previously given consent to process their personal data.</li>
<li>Right to object: Data subjects have the right to object to the processing of their personal data.</li>
<li>Right to object to automated processing: Data subjects have the right to object to decisions being made with their data solely based on automated decision making or profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these rights may be limited in some circumstances under applicable law. When you make a request to exercise your rights under GDPR, we may ask you to provide additional information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.</p>
<p>To submit your GDPR request and exercise any of your rights under GDPR, please contact our support team at: <a href="mailto:playloool.game@gmail.com">playloool.game@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, if you are in the EEA and you have any complaints about how we use your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your country. A list of data protection authorities can be found here.</p>
<p>Bases for Using Your Information</p>
<p>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply. These conditions are called “legal bases” and, at LO_OL, we typically rely on one of four:</p>
<p>Contract. We might use your information is because you have entered into an agreement with us to use the LO_OL app.</p>
<p>Legitimate interest. We might use your information because we have—or a third party has—a legitimate interest in doing so. For example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including protecting your account, providing customer support, and helping you find friends and content we think you will like. Please note that our legitimate interests do not outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data does not significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so.</p>
<p>Consent.We may ask for consent to use your information for a specific purpose. If we request consent, we will make sure that you can revoke your consent through our settings.</p>
<p>Legal obligation.We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law such as when we respond to valid legal proceeding inquiries or need to take action to protect our users.</p>
<p>Complaints or Questions</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, please contact our support team at: <a href="mailto:playloool.game@gmail.com">playloool.game@gmail.com</a>.</p>
