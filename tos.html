  <h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
  <h2 id="effective-december-16-2022">Effective: December 16, 2022</h2>
  <p>These Terms of Service (referred to as the &quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of our Services. These Terms form a legally binding contract between you and Livehouse Ltd. (&quot;LOOOL&quot;). So please read them carefully!</p>
  <p>By using LOOOL or any of our other products or services that are subject to these Terms (which are referred to collectively as &quot;Services&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with them, then you can opt to not use our services.</p>

  <p>You may use LOOOL only if you can legally form a binding contract with LOOOL, and only in compliance with these Terms and other applicable laws. When you create a LOOOL account, you must provide us with accurate and complete information. You can’t use LOOOL if it would be prohibited by the United States or any other applicable jurisdictions. Any use or access by anyone under the age of 13 is not allowed. If you are based in the EU, EEA, or UK, you may only use LOOOL if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country. Using LOOOL may include downloading software to your computer, phone, tablet, or other device. You agree that we may automatically update that software, and these Terms will apply to any updates.

  <ul>
  <li>you can form a binding contract with LOOOL;</li>

  <li>you are not a convicted sex offender;</li>
  <li><p>you will comply with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.</p>

This license is for the sole purpose of using and enjoying the Services in a way that these Terms and our policies, such as our privacy policy, allow. You may not use the Services in ways that are not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.</p>

  <p>We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. By using the Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms and any other policies LOOOL makes available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.</p>
  <p>If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and notify third parties—including law enforcement—and provide those third parties with information relating to your account. This step may be necessary to protect the safety of our users, and others, to investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations, and to detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</p>
  <p>We also care about your physical safety while using our Services. So do not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while driving.</p>
  <ol>

Neither LOOOL nor our affiliates are responsible or liable for a third party’s terms or actions taken under the third party’s terms. Further, by using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that LOOOL is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or websites.

  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>LOOOL may suspend the use of all or part of the Services, suspend or delete accounts, cancel any agreement between a User and LOOOL with respect to the Services (including, without limitation, any agreement based on these Terms and Conditions, hereinafter the same) or take any other measure LOOOL reasonably determines to be necessary and appropriate without prior notice to such User in the case that such User falls under or there is a possibility that such User falls under any of the following items:</li>

  <li><ol>
  <li>In the case where LOOOL suffers loss/damages either directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, attorney fees) due to a User’s use of the Services (including, without limitation, cases where LOOOL receives a complaint from a third party due to such use), the User shall immediately compensate LOOOL for such loss/damage in accordance with LOOOL’s request.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><p>Modifying the Services and Termination</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time for any reason, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</p>
  <p>While we hope you remain a lifelong user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your LOOOL account (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of the Services you are using).</p>
  <p>We may terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if you fail to comply with these Terms, any of our guidelines, or the law, for any reason outside of our control, or for any reason, and without advanced notice. That means that we may terminate these Terms, stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. And while we’ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can’t guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances. For example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.</p>
  <p>Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and LOOOL continue to be bound by these Terms.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Indemnity</li>
  </ol>
  <p>You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless LOOOL, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services, or any products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services, even if recommended, made available, or approved by LOOOL; (b) your content, including infringement claims related to your content; (c) your breach of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; or (d) your negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Disclaimers</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.</p>
  <p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.</p>
  <p>NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR ASSUME LIABILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES, UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF WHICH WE OR OUR AFFILIATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Limitation of Liability</li>
  </ol>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>
  <p>THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO JURISDICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</li>
  </ol>
  <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND LOOOL AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p>
  <p>For any dispute you have with LOOOL, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute with us informally. If LOOOL is not able to resolve the dispute informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration.</p>
  <p>Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. For instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Although the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and LOOOL are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your LOOOL account.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You and LOOOL agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and LOOOL are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (<a href="https://www.adrservices.com/">https://www.adrservices.com/</a>). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $$10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $$10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at<a href="https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/">https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/</a>. If LOOOL is the party initiating an arbitration against you, LOOOL will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against LOOOL, you will be responsible for the first $100 toward the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee, and LOOOL will pay the remainder of your Initial Filing fee and both parties’ Administrative Fee.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and LOOOL. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and LOOOL.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND LOOOL WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and LOOOL are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and LOOOL over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND LOOOL WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in this section .</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor LOOOL can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify LOOOL in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your name and the phone number you used to set up your LOOOL account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either email the opt-out notice to help <a href="mailto:playloool.game@gmail.com">playloool.game@gmail.com</a></li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or LOOOL may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><ol>
  <li>Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with LOOOL.</li>
  </ol>
